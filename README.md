🚀 PDF-Only RAG Chatbot (LangGraph + Azure OpenAI + Streamlit)

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Chatbot that lets users upload PDF documents (text-based only, no OCR) and ask questions about their contents.
It uses LangGraph to manage conversation state, Chroma as a vector database, and Azure OpenAI for both embeddings and chat completions.
The UI is built with Streamlit and supports true streaming responses.
